# DeliciousFoodBlog
I am creating web site where we all can share our favorite food recipes.

To start this project you will need v8.9.4 of nodeJS and v5.6.0 of npm.

First install Git Bash, download here: https://git-scm.com/downloads).
Then clone this project executing: git clone https://github.com/David-Anicic/DeliciousFoodBlog.git 

If you installed nodeJs, at the root of the project execute command: npm start server.js

Then in your favorite web browser open localhost:8081.

ENJOY!!!
